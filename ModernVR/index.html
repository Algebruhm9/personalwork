        <p id="intro"> Welcome to the future of virtual reality. Where we take the most bleeding edge
            tech and integrate it into our VR headsets to give users a taste of what living in another world is like.
            Where not only can you see inside a virtual world but are able to walk freely and move your body freely inside this world.
            With our headsets and accessory add ons, this dream of having a second life in the virtual world is slowly coming to life. 
            Advanced camera's like the Mocap X1 not only track your movements without the use of gyro's strapped to your body but can also
            bring your clothes into VR as well with high details and tracking on how they move in the real world. To our most advanced headset 
            that can track eye movement and facial expressions and can provide full 3D audio and can adjust the lens to better simulate
            perception and focusing. This is the future of not only virtual reality, but the world. And we plan to lead it into the future.
