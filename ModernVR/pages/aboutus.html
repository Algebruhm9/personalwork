<hr>
    <div class="paragraph">Our ambitious story began back in 2015 with three friends trying to figure out
        what to do next in our lives. We were fresh out of college, disillusioned by what people have told us about
        the great life of college and the there after. We had to come up with something to do as we didn't want the last 4 years
        of our lives to be a waste. So during the week we would go job searching, getting any interview and job we had interest in, hoping
        to score something. But during the weekends we would make the best of them by playing with anything we could get our hands with.
        We all saved up for a virtual reality headset at that time and were blown away at what it had to offer. For something
        that was still in its infancy stage, we were blown away at how another world could become so close to reality that one of my friends
        Josh hit a wall running from enemy fire. That then and there struck a flame in all three of us, well my Josh a little too well, and we set
        off to create the vr headset we wished we could have during that time.

    <h3 class="titleheader">The beginning ideas & prototypes</h3>
    <div class="paragraph"> We won't lie, building something that has never been done before ain't easy. Our first ideas were...
        well rough and ambitious even for the best companies out there at the time. So we scaled back on our brainstorming. We
        first started with what was available now and tried our best to replicate it, change it up and add our own vision onto it.
        Are we admitting to having our first prototypes being copies of other headsets out there? Yes, yes we are and it's what helped
        us understand why companies did what they did and inspired us so that we could build our own headset and ideas. It was during our fifth working 
        prototype that we knew we were on the right path towards creating a good beginner product. So we marched on until we got to our tenth working prototype.
        That's when we had a breakthrough in better tracking technology and facial feature tracking.

    <h3 class="titleheader">Our breakthrough through the struggles</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">We had exhausted every resource and brain power we had by the tenth prototype. We gave it our all and then some with 
        the help of other contributors interested in our product. But our breakthrough didn't come from brute forcing our way through a problem. We 
        tried to improve and upgrade the current technology used to track limb and head movement that we decided on an AI and the help of more sensors 
        to lighten the load of processing a lot of data realtime by predicting the next set of movements and enhancing the rate at which data was sent, processed
        and executed upon receiving it. This basically meant that we were processing and acting upon the data before the next batch of data even arrived.
        This allowed for faster reaction times, smoother movement in game and more flexibility when moving around the play area with the help of the extra sensors.
